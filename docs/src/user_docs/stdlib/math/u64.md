# Unsigned 64-bit integer operations
Module `std::math::u64` contains a set of procedures which can be used to perform unsigned 64-bit integer operations. These operations fall into the following categories:

* **Arithmetic operations** - addition, multiplication, division etc.
* **Comparison operations** - equality, less than, greater than etc.
* **Bitwise operations** - binary AND, OR, XOR, bit shifts etc.

All procedures assume that an unsigned 64-bit integer (u64) is encoded using two elements, each containing an unsigned 32-bit integer (u32). When placed on the stack, the least-significant limb is assumed to be deeper in the stack. For example, a u64 value `a` consisting of limbs `a_hi` and `a_lo` would be position on the stack like so:
```
[a_hi, a_lo, ... ]
```

Procedures which check whether the input values are encoded correctly are designated with `checked` prefix. For example, `checked_add` would fail if any of the top 4 elements on the stack contains a value greater than $2^{32} - 1$. In contrast, `wrapping_add` and `overflowing_add` would not perform these checks, and therefore, if any of the top 4 stack elements is greater than $2^{32} - 1$, the operation will not fail but rather will produce an undefined result. Thus, when using versions of procedures which are not checked, it is important to be certain that input values are 32-bit limbs encoding valid u64 values.

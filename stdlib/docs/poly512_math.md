| mul_zq | Given two polynomials of degree 512 on stack as absolute memory addresses,<br /><br />this routine computes polynomial multiplication, using NTT and iNTT.<br /><br />Imagine, two polynomials are f, g<br /><br />h = f . g, can be computed using<br /><br />iNTT(NTT(f) * NTT(g))<br /><br />Note, * -> element wise multiplication of polynomial coefficients in NTT domain<br /><br />Input stack state :<br /><br />[f_start_addr, g_start_addr, h_start_addr, ...]<br /><br />- {f, g, h}_addr`i` -> {f, g, h}[ (i << 2) ..

| neg_zq | Given one polynomial of degree 512 on stack as absolute memory addresses,<br /><br />this routine negates each coefficient of that polynomial.<br /><br />Imagine, polynomial f<br /><br />g = -f, can be computed as<br /><br />[(-f[i]) % Q for i in range(512)] \| Q = 12289 ( = Falcon Digital Signature Algorithm's Prime Number )<br /><br />Input stack state :<br /><br />[f_start_addr, g_start_addr, ...]<br /><br />- {f,g}_addr`i` -> {f,g}[ (i << 2) ..

| sub_zq | Given two polynomials of degree 512 on stack as absolute memory addresses,<br /><br />this routine subtracts second polynomial from first one.<br /><br />Imagine, two polynomials f, g<br /><br />h = f - g, can be computed as<br /><br />[(f[i] - g[i]) % Q for i in range(512)] \| Q = 12289 ( = Falcon Digital Signature Algorithm's Prime Number )<br /><br />Input stack state :<br /><br />[f_start_addr, g_start_addr, h_start_addr ...]<br /><br />- {f, g, h}_addr`i` -> {f, g, h}[ (i << 2) ..

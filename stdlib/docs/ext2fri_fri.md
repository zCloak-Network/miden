| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| verify_remainder_64 | Given memory address of the remainder codeword with 64 evaluations, this routine attempts to<br /><br />probabilistically verify that the codeword contains evaluations of a degree 7 polynomial.<br /><br />Expected stack state:<br /><br />[q_ptr, ...]<br /><br />A few assumptions about q_ptr:<br /><br />- q_ptr is an absolute memory address of the beginning of remainder codeword.<br /><br />- Each evaluation is 2 elements wide because they belong to quadratic extension field (meaning<br /><br />each memory address will hold two consecutive evaluations)<br /><br />- Words (four field elements), in memory, are laid out in this order (a0_0, a0_1, a1_0, a1_1).<br /><br />This means that (a0_1, a0_0) -> first evaluation and (a1_1, a1_0) -> next evaluation<br /><br />- Next 31 memory addresses should be holding remaining 62 evaluations. That is, if q_ptr holds<br /><br />(a0_0, a0_1, a1_0, a1_1), then q_ptr + 1, must hold (a2_0, a2_1, a3_0, a3_1), and q_ptr + 31<br /><br />should be holding (a62_0, a62_1, a63_0, a63_1).<br /><br />At the end of execution q_ptr is popped off the stack.<br /><br />If remainder verification fails, execution of the program stops. |
| verify_remainder_32 | Given memory address of the remainder codeword with 32 evaluations, this routine attempts to<br /><br />probabilistically verify that the codeword contains evaluations of a degree 3 polynomial.<br /><br />Expected stack state:<br /><br />[q_ptr, ...]<br /><br />A few assumptions about q_ptr:<br /><br />- q_ptr is an absolute memory address of the beginning of remainder codeword.<br /><br />- Each evaluation is 2 elements wide because they belong to quadratic extension field (meaning<br /><br />each memory address will hold two consecutive evaluations)<br /><br />- Words (four field elements), in memory, are laid out in this order (a0_0, a0_1, a1_0, a1_1).<br /><br />This means that (a0_1, a0_0) -> first evaluation and (a1_1, a1_0) -> next evaluation<br /><br />- Next 15 memory addresses should be holding remaining 30 evaluations. That is, if q_ptr holds<br /><br />(a0_0, a0_1, a1_0, a1_1), then q_ptr + 1, must hold (a2_0, a2_1, a3_0, a3_1), and q_ptr + 15<br /><br />should be holding (a30_0, a30_1, a31_0, a31_1).<br /><br />At the end of execution q_ptr is popped off the stack.<br /><br />If remainder verification fails, execution of the program stops. |

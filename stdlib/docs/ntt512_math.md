| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| forward | Applies forward NTT on a vector of length 512, where each element ∈ Zp \| p = 2^64 − 2^32 + 1,<br /><br />producing elements in frequency domain in bit-reversed order.<br /><br />Expected stack state as input:<br /><br />[start_addr, ...] \| Single absolute memory address, where polynomial starts<br /><br />Note, total 128 memory addresses are required for storing whole polynomial. Next 127<br /><br />addresses are consecutive i.e. computable by using `add.1` instruction on previous address.<br /><br />addr{i} holds values V[(i << 2) .. ((i+1) << 2)] \| i ∈ [0, 128) and addr0 = start_addr<br /><br />After applying NTT, bit-reversed order vector is returned back as single absolute memory<br /><br />addresses on stack, where it begins storing the polynomial. Consecutive 127 addresses should be<br /><br />computable using `add.1` instruction.<br /><br />[start_addr', ...] \| Single absolute memory address, where resulting polynomial starts<br /><br />Note, input memory allocation is not mutated, instead output is stored in different memory allocation. |
| backward | Applies inverse NTT on a vector of length 512, where each element ∈ Zp \| p = 2^64 − 2^32 + 1,<br /><br />producing elements in time domain in standard order, while input vector is expected to be in<br /><br />bit-reversed order.<br /><br />Expected stack state as input:<br /><br />[start_addr, ...] \| Single absolute memory address, where polynomial starts<br /><br />Note, total 128 memory addresses are required for storing whole polynomial. Next 127<br /><br />addresses are consecutive i.e. computable by using `add.1` instruction on previous address.<br /><br />addr{i} holds values V[(i << 2) .. ((i+1) << 2)] \| i ∈ [0, 128) and addr0 = start_addr<br /><br />After applying iNTT, normal order vector is returned back as single absolute memory<br /><br />addresses on stack, where it begins storing the polynomial. Consecutive 127 addresses should<br /><br />similarly be computable using `add.1` instruction.<br /><br />[start_addr', ...] \| Single absolute memory address, where resulting polynomial starts<br /><br />Note, input memory allocation is not mutated, instead output is stored in different memory allocation. |
